**NASA Pic Of The Day Viewer**

This project was made to aid my application to DataSoc for the technical (IT) director of DataSoc 2025.
This project fetches and displays the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" (APOD) from the NASA API. It provides a dynamic web page showcasing NASA's daily image or video, along with its title, description, and date.


**Fetch Data from a Public API:**

This project uses the NASA APOD API to fetch daily data (image or video) of astronomy phenomena. the API key was 2naW8efKGaUPpN61Mi78POXBbYW783Fgffursrtp, which i recieved through my mail from the website 

The JavaScript fetch() function is used to make GET requests to the API endpoint.


**Display the Fetched Data in a User-Friendly Format on a Web Page:**

The fetched data is dynamically displayed on a responsive web page.

The page includes the title, description, and media (image or video) provided by the API, styled for readability and visual appeal.
